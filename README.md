### Description

This is not a complex beast.

It really is elementary code to convert a CSV file with difficult commas to a tab delimited text file.

As I couldn't find a pure and simple method on PSC, I thought that I would upload it as a stand-alone prj for simplicity's sake.

Enjoy!

Cheers,

Kevin
